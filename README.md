# LFSR
What is an LFSR?
 - A linear-feedback shift register is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.
 - The initial content of the shift register is referred to as a seed. (Note: any value can be a seed except all 0â€™s to avoid the lookup state. Lookup state is the state in which shift register values are always zeros while shifting and XORing).
 - Feedback can be comprised of XOR gates or XNOR gates.

LFSR Applications
1)	Pattern Generators
2)	Encryption
3)	Compression
4)	CRC
5)	Pseudo-Random Bit Sequences (PRBS)
